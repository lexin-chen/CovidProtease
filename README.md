# Covid Protease


SARS-COV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been the main drug target for COVID-19 treatment. An efficacious inhibitor was searched to block viral maturation. Boceprevir, bromocriptine, manidipine, and periciazine are chosen ligands of interest from docking scores and previous experimental assay results. 

As part of my final project for a computational chemistry course (CHM6586), docking, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculation using MMPBSA were conducted.
