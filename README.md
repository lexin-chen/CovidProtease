# Covid Protease

SARS-COV-2 main protease (Mpro) has been the main drug target for COVID-19 treatment. An
efficacious inhibitor was searched to block viral maturation. Boceprevir, bromocriptine, manidipine,
and periciazine are chosen ligands of interest from docking scores and previous experimental assay
results.
docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculation using MMPBSA were conducted.
